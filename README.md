<h3>Introduction</h3>
This webpage is suppused to represent an interface that makes wierdly named files with wierd content because National Tax and Customs Administration of Hungary makes people do these by themselves.
If you find this somehow, don't judge me! I know this code is faulty at plenty of places, but it's just a quickly made prototype that works... sufficiently.
<h3>Made in CakePHP 2.6.4.</h3>
Go to http://cakephp.org/ for more info. 

<h3>How to use</h3> 
(I am just going to write down my way to make this work):
<ol>
  <li> Installed XAMPP, start Apache and MySQL. </li>
  <li> Create a database, import .sql file. It's in the abevcake's root directory. </li>
  <li> Set up database in /app/config file. There is a "database.example.php" file there, I think it's a good starting point. </li>
  <li> Hopefully, it will work now. The generated files will be in webroot/GENERATED_FILES folder. </li>
</ol>
