This webpage is suppused to represent an interface that makes wierdly named files with wierd content becouse National Tax and Customs Administration of Hungary makes people do these by people themselves.
If you find this somehow, don't judge me! I know this code is faulty at plenty of places, but it's just a quick (made by around 12 hours work... and I am not an expert) prototype that functions... sufficiently.

Made in CakePHP 2.6.4.

How to use this (I am just going to write down my way to make this work):
  0. Installed XAMPP, start Apache and MySQL
  1. Import .sql file. It's in the abevcake's root directory (at least it should be).
  2. Set up database in /app/config file. Should be named database.php.
  3. Hopefully, it will work now. The generated files will be in webroot/GENERATED_FILES folder.
